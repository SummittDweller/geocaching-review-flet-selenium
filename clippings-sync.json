My name is **Iowa.Landmark**, and I'm one of the Geocaching.com volunteer cache reviewers for Iowa.  Reviewers role is to review and publish caches, and provide guidance when necessary.\n\nPart of our job is to make sure new caches comply with the guidelines before they are published.  The guidelines are listed here:\nhttp://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx?expand=1 for your convenience.  Please don't submit a cache listing for review until you have read and understand these guidelines.\n\nAs for cache placements, here are a few friendly suggestions:\n\nCache Saturation\nThe reviewers use a rule of thumb that caches placed within .10 miles (528 feet or 161 meters) of another cache may not be listed on the site. This is an arbitrary distance and is just a guideline. Please note that the purpose of the Saturation Guideline is to prevent too many caches from being placed in one area, and to encourage people to seek out new places for caches. It is not intended to prevent one cache from being found too quickly after another, nor is it concerned with the walking distance between caches. As such, we use true \"as the crow flies\" distances, not travel or route distance.\n\n1. Label the outside of your cache container - this will help those that stumble upon it identify what it is.\n2. Include a cache note as part of the initial contents if possible - cache notes can be found here: http://www.geocaching.com/articles/geocachenote.doc\n3. Please include attributes on your cache page as most geocachers find them very helpful. Attributes are explained here: http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=121\n4. If you don't have a hint - leave the hint field blank. It's annoying for many geocachers to decrypt a hint that ends up saying \"No Hints\" or \"maybe later\".\n\nWhen you submit your cache to be reviewed, including 3 bits of information in a reviewer note can make the process much faster.\n\nA) Please explain the property your cache is placed on. Any cache that is on private property should have permission from the property owner.\nhttp://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#permission\nB) Please explain what type of container your cache is. \nC) Please explain exactly how and where your cache is hidden.\n\nGenerally speaking - the more information you can provide in the initial submission, the quicker the reviewing process goes, and the faster your cache gets published!   It's likely that I will need to know more about how the cache is actually hidden to make sure it meets the guidelines published at:  http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx.  At a minimum please include the following:\n\n  - a brief description of the container\n    - material, \n    - color, \n    - size, etc.\n  - a brief description of the location \n    - in a park, \n    - along a trail, \n    - at a residence (with permission of course),\n    - at a business (again, with permission),\n    - in the public ROW, etc.\n  - a more detailed description of the container location \n    - how high off the ground, \n    - inside a hole, \n    - attached to what, \n    - which side of the beacon, etc.\n  \nI've recently learned that in some locations new cache listings must include photos of the surrounding area, the container, and its hiding spot.  Iowa has not adopted a requirement like this yet, but feel free to include photos if you have them, it can really help speed up this process.\n\nPlease put all of this information into the Reviewer Note that you create each time you submit a listing for review.  Also remember, no reviewer will see your changes until you submit the listing for review, and any conversation we have via Reviewer Notes will be visible only to you and the reviewing team.   \n\nFeel free to contact reviewers directly any time if you need help or advice.\n\nDuring a review we'll occasionally see something that we might need to be explained or changed.  Our preferred method of communication is through Reviewer Notes. Before your cache is published, these reviewer notes are only visible to you and me. If you're not familiar with this process, see the instructions [here](http://support.groundspeak.com//index.php?pg=kb.page&id=74).\nWhen your cache is published, the reviewer notes are automatically hidden, and are thereafter only visible to reviewers as a historic record of the review process.\n\nThanks and take care.\n\n**Iowa.Landmark**\nIowa.Landmark.60@gmail.com\n\n_Please ALWAYS reference cache GC identifiers if emailing._\n\nHow to get your cache published quickly: http://tinyurl.com/yhnva3g\nGeocaching Knowledge Books http://tinyurl.com/yd459kh\nFrequently Asked Questions http://tinyurl.com/2re5k6\nThe Guidelines http://tinyurl.com/bdf5m", "shortcutKey": "", "sourceURL": "", "label": "", "seq": 0, "sid": "ece77142-1882-44c7-b893-5a9270471d68"}, {"name": "What to Expect After You Submit a Geocache for Review", "content": "_The following text was captured and slightly modified from a January 2023 blog post at https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2023/01/what-to-expect-after-you-submit-a-geocache-for-review/._\n\nYou found the perfect location and the perfect container, you checked to make sure it all complies with the guidelines, and after putting the final touches on the cache page for your new hide, you submit your new geocache for publication. \n\nCongratulations! You\u2019re now just one step away from having your new hide published on the geocaching map. This final step, the review process, is an important one and it can look very different for each cache hide. Below, we\u2019re sharing three scenarios to demystify the process and help new hiders know what to expect after they hit the submit button.\n\n## Scenario 1: Your geocache is published\n\nIf you\u2019ve reviewed the guidelines and put thought into your geocache and its location, there\u2019s a good chance that your geocaching community volunteer reviewer won\u2019t have any questions or feedback and will publish it after they look over the submission. It\u2019s important to remember, though, that even if everything is good to go with your new cache hide, it can still take time before it is published. Typically, review begins within seven days of the date that you submit your cache, but it may take longer in the week before or after holidays and large geocaching Events.\n\n## Scenario 2: Your reviewer needs more information\n\nSometimes your reviewer will need more information about your geocache in order to complete the review process. Common questions a reviewer might ask are:\n\n    How is your cache hidden?\n    What container did you use?\n    If it\u2019s not close to your home, what is your plan for maintaining it?\n\nIf this kind of information is not in the cache description for your hide, you can **post a reviewer note log on your cache page after submitting it in order to communicate the information to your reviewer, then be sure to SUBMIT the cache page for another review.  This is how to best communicate with your reviewer!  Email is NOT a good option.**  Reviewer Note logs won\u2019t appear on the cache page after it\u2019s published but they will be visible to reviewers who use them to capture the \"history\" of the review process.  \n\n## Scenario 3: Something needs to change\n\nAnother common scenario is that your reviewer will catch something about your geocache that needs to change before they can publish it. For example, your geocache might be closer than .1 miles from the final location or physical waypoint of a Multi-Cache or Mystery Cache, or it might be too close to a restricted area such as railroad property. If you get this kind of news from your reviewer, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not in trouble, your reviewer is just helping to make sure that your new geocache is safe and will create great experiences for everyone who finds it. **The best thing you can do is to promptly respond to your reviewer by taking action to change whatever needs to be changed (or just ask questions) and describe the changes (or questions) in a Reviewer Note, and again, make sure you SUBMIT the cache page for another review!**  \n\n# Important! \n\nPlease use Reviewer Notes to communicate with your reviewer, not email!  If you must send an email PLEASE be sure to list the GCxxxxx code of your cache listing in your message.  Reviewers might see 100's of new listings in the span of a week or month, they can't possibly know which listing you are talking about unless you include the GCxxxxx code!  \n\nAlso, always be sure to SUBMIT your cache pages for another review after you make a change, and describe the changes in your Reviewer Note!  Your reviewer won't see your changes until you SUBMIT them!  Rinse and repeat.  This cycle of responding with a Reviewer Note, SUBMIT, review, and repeat may take several iterations.  Please be patient.  \n\n-Iowa.Landmark\n", "shortcutKey": "", "sourceURL": "", "label": "", "seq": 1, "sid": "1e6186c8-6556-4034-a0f5-e42f627aff00"}, {"name": "I see you have fewer than 20 finds.", "content": "I see you have fewer than 20 finds.

Thanks for your cache submission.\n\nI have some concerns about your listing with respect to the guidelines for placing a cache.  The particular guideline in this case is documented at http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#cachemaintenance\n\nYour geocaching.com profile puts your home more than 100 miles from this cache location. Caches need to be maintained, and that may be hard to do if you live far away. If the cache gets wet or damaged, you need to be able to repair, replace or remove the remains in a timely manner. Anything less and your cache becomes litter. This litter has the potential to give all geocachers a bad reputation, which is why the guidelines mentioned above states:\n\n**Placing Caches on Vacation/Beyond Your Maintainable Distance**\n\nPlacing caches on vacation or outside of your normal caching area is unacceptable and these caches may not be listed. As the cache owner you are obligated to be in a position to manage your caches, and caches placed on vacation require someone else to maintain them for you. It is not uncommon for areas to be cleared, trails to be blocked or closed, objects used for multi-cache or puzzles to be moved or removed, etc. You must be able to react to negative cache logs and investigate the location quickly. Please be responsible. This guideline applies to all types of caches.\n\nThe territory in which a geocacher is able to maintain caches responsibly will vary from one person to the next. An active geocacher who regularly visits areas hundreds of miles apart can demonstrate their ability to maintain a cache 100 miles from home. A geocacher whose previous finds and hides are all within 25 miles of their home would likely not see their cache listed if placed 250 miles away from their home.\n\nIf you have special circumstances, please describe these on your cache page or in a note to the reviewer. For example, if you have made arrangements with a local geocacher to watch over your distant cache for you, that geocacher\u2019s name should be mentioned on your cache page.\n\nSince you don't indicate that you have a local person to help out in this cache, or an acceptable maintenance plan, I'm afraid I can't publish it on geocaching.com.\n\nI am temporarily disabling this cache but when repairs to this cache page are completed and it is time to have it reposted, it will be no problem. You can re-enable the cache page http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=301 by clicking the link under the cache name or by checking the box that says the cache is active. That will place it back in the review queue. You may also drop me a note and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you. To respond, please do NOT send me an e-mail. Leave a new \"Reviewer Note\" log here on your cache page. If you're not familiar with this process, see the instructions [here](http://support.groundspeak.com//index.php?pg=kb.page&id=74).  I have your cache on my watchlist, and I will receive a notification when you write your note.  All reviewer notes are deleted when your cache is published.\n\nThanks and take care.\n\n**Iowa.Landmark**\nIowa.Landmark.60@gmail.com", "shortcutKey": "", "sourceURL": "", "label": "", "seq": 4, "sid": "4e36f5e5-8ab4-4454-88b5-0649c4ffef4a"}, {"name": "Non-Helpful Hint: Remove or Replace ", "content": "I suggest you remove or replace your Hint.
